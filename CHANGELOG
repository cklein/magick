Version 0.6
  Added define statement so it would compile with Image Magick 6.2.3
  Changed magick.imresize to magick.resize

Version 0.5
  Added Windows Installer (and modified setup.py file)
  Added Image Annotation (special character handling)
  Added Get Type Metric code. 

Version 0.4.2
  Bugfixes.  This version works with Kiva backend.

Version 0.4
  Added support for drawing clipping masks.
  Clipping masks are masks where transparency is used to prevent operations
    from occuring when internal syncing is done.  Some operations make use of them
    and some don't (it depends on whether or not internal Clone Images use 0,0 for
    exact copies or not).  
  All image methods make use of clipping masks.  Most of the magick function
    operations do not. 
  You can always use img.setpixels(somefunc(img,...).toarray()) to apply the result
    of an operation using the clipping path. 

Version 0.3
  Bug fixes from testing through several examples
  Addition of floats as entries for resizing given scaling factors
  Addition of many examples in examples.py to show how to use the interface
  Change resize to imresize  to not interfere with Numeric

Version 0.2
  Added most of the drawing commands

Version 0.1
  First release
