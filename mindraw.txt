# Font Handling
It looks like image magick can take either an xfont name
(and it will use X to render the font)

Or it can take a filename (*.ttf  -- uses Freetype)
                          (*.pfb  -- uses Ghostscript) 

to render the font. 

If desired a "@" can be inserted in front of the font name to
force freetype rendering. 

So, choosing the font amounts to choosing the filename. 
If the font cannot be found, then an error will occur while drawing.
